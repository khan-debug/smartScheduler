# How to Create a New MongoDB Atlas Cluster

## Why Create a New Cluster?
Your current cluster hostname cannot be resolved - it's likely deleted, paused, or misconfigured.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Go to MongoDB Atlas
- Visit: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
- Log in with your account

### 2. Create a New Cluster (FREE TIER)
1. Click **"Build a Database"** or **"Create"**
2. Choose **"M0 FREE"** tier
3. Select a **cloud provider** (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure)
4. Choose a **region** close to you for better performance
5. Give it a name (e.g., `smartscheduler-cluster`)
6. Click **"Create Deployment"**

### 3. Create Database User
1. You'll be prompted to create a username and password
   - Username: `smartscheduler_user` (or your choice)
   - Password: Use **"Autogenerate Secure Password"** - SAVE THIS!
2. Click **"Create Database User"**

### 4. CRITICAL: Add IP Address to Network Access
⚠️ **This is the most important step!**

1. You'll see "Where would you like to connect from?"
2. Click **"Add My Current IP Address"**
   - OR add `0.0.0.0/0` for testing (allows all IPs - not for production!)
3. Click **"Add Entry"**
4. Click **"Finish and Close"**

### 5. Get Connection String
1. Click **"Connect"** on your cluster
2. Choose **"Drivers"**
3. Select **"Python"** and version **"3.6 or later"**
4. Copy the connection string - it looks like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@smartscheduler-cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
5. Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual credentials

### 6. Update app.py
Once you have the connection string, come back and I'll update the app.py file with it.

## Common Issues to Avoid

❌ **DON'T** forget to add your IP to Network Access
❌ **DON'T** forget to save your database password
❌ **DON'T** use special characters in password that need URL encoding
✅ **DO** use the autogenerated password for simplicity
✅ **DO** add your current IP address
✅ **DO** choose a region close to you

## After Creating the Cluster

Once you have:
1. ✓ Created the cluster
2. ✓ Created database user
3. ✓ Added IP to Network Access
4. ✓ Got the connection string

**Send me the connection string** and I'll:
- Update app.py with the new URI
- Test the connection
- Get your application running!

## Expected Timeline
- Cluster creation: 3-10 minutes
- Configuration: 1-2 minutes
- Testing: 1 minute
